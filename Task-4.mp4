In Frappe Framework, a Form is the UI you see when you open or create a document (like Customer, Lead, Item, etc.).

1) FORM:  A form is based on a DocType and includes:

-> Fields (Data, Date, Select, int etc.)

-> Buttons (Save, Submit)

-> Client-side logic (via Custom Scripts)

-> Server-side logic (via Python)

2) CUSTOM SCRIPTS: Custom Scripts let you write JavaScript to control form behavior without touching core code.

-> Validate data before saving

-> Auto-fill fields

-> Show warnings/errors

-> Control field visibility

-> Add custom buttons
